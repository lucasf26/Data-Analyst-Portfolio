# Lucas Ferraris - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Lucas! I am Mechanical Engineer and Msc. in Engineering, working in the National Comision of Atomic Energy (CNEA) in Argentina. I have developed a strong foundation in the engineering sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
