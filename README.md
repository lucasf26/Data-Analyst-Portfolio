# Lucas Ferraris - Data Science Portfolio
## About Me:
Hi, I'm Lucas! I am Mechanical Engineer and Msc. in Engineering. I'm living in Bariloche, Argentina, working as Thermalhydraulic Analyst in CNEA (National Commission of Atomic Energy).

During my studies and jobs, I have developed a strong foundation in mathematics and science, a passion for using data to discover meaningful insights, and for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management and statistical analysis.

I am excited to bring my analytical skills to the field of data science.

## Relevant skills:
* Strong foundation in math: algebra, calculus, statistics and probab. 
* Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sci-Kit Learn, Keras).
* SQLite.
* Excel.
* Matlab/Octave.
* Fortran 77/90.
* Git/GitHub.
* English (intermediate).
